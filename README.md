# 🎙️ Low-Resource Automatic Speech Recognition using Self-Supervised Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on building an **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** system for low-resource Indian languages using state-of-the-art self-supervised speech models.

Low-resource languages often lack sufficient annotated speech data, making traditional ASR approaches ineffective. This project leverages pretrained transformer-based speech models and fine-tunes them on limited labeled datasets to improve transcription performance.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Fine-tuned Wav2Vec 2.0
- Experimented with WavLM
- Trained on Microsoft Indian Language Speech Corpus
- Focused on Telugu and other low-resource Indian languages
- Conducted dataset scaling experiments
- Analyzed training instability during mid-training steps
- Evaluated performance using Word Error Rate (WER)

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Building robust ASR systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to:

- Limited annotated speech data
- Pronunciation and dialect variability
- Data imbalance
- Overfitting on small datasets

This project investigates how self-supervised pretrained models can improve ASR performance under such constraints.

## 📊 Experiments

### Dataset Scaling Study

| Dataset Size | Observation |
|--------------|------------|
| Small subset | Faster convergence but high overfitting |
| Medium subset | Improved generalization |
| Larger subset | Lower WER but increased training time |

### Training Instability Analysis

Observed behavior around 2000–2400 steps:
- Temporary increase in validation loss
- Possible causes:
  - Learning rate adjustments
  - Overfitting
  - Gradient instability
  - Data distribution shifts

This analysis helped refine training strategy and hyperparameter tuning.
